    "description": "An Imperial Black Belgian Ale aged in old Invergordon Scotch whisky barrels with mountains of raspberries, tayberries and blackberries in each cask. Decadent but light and dry, this beer would make a fantastic base for ageing on pretty much any dark fruit - we used raspberries, tayberries and blackberries beause they were local."

    "description": "Good old Bramling Cross is elegant, refined, assured, (boring) and understated. Understated that is unless you hop the living daylights out of a beer with it. This is Bramling Cross re-invented and re-imagined, and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. Poor Bramling Cross normally gets lost in a woeful stream of conformist brown ales made by sleepy cask ale brewers. But not anymore. This beer shows that British hops do have some soul, and is a fruity riot of blackberries, pears, and plums. Reminds me of the bramble, apple and ginger jam my grandmother used to make."

    "description": "This recipe is for the Belgian Tripel base. A blend of two huge oak aged beers – half a hopped up Belgian Tripel, and half a Triple India Pale Ale. Both aged in single grain whisky barrels for two years and blended, each beer brings its own character to the mix. The Belgian Tripel comes loaded with complex spicy, fruity esters, and punchy citrus hop character."

The 12.5% Barley Wine fermented well, and the champagne yeast drew it ever closer to 12.5%. The beer was brewed with a single hop variety and was going to be partially aged in oak casks."

The Belgian yeast strain introduces a whole new dimension to the Imperial Stout style resulting in a beer that resembles a marshmallow toasted on a smouldering barbeque then smothered in dark chocolate.

    "description": "A hop that tastes of bubble gum? Seriously? No, we did not believe it either. But it does! This is one unique, son of a bitch of a hop. Lemony, deep, musty with a smoothness that belies its power. This hop is lemony like a lemon who was angry earlier but is now tired because of all the rage. This hop of Japanese origin is best enjoyed trying to make sushi from your gold fish, or trying to persuade your girlfriend (or boyfriend maybe) to dress up as a Geisha for Valentine’s Day."

This was a defining moment in BrewDog prehistory, and that beer was the first incarnation of the ubiquitous Paradox. Aged in a variety of casks over the years, Paradox is dark, decadent and encapsulating. Can be enjoyed fresh; phenomenal when aged."

    "description": "Hardcore IPA with raspberries aged in Caol Ila casks. Full-bodied and compelling, the robust malt base provides an initial layer of honey, cinnamon and biscuity malt sweetness. Soon the Scottish berries are in on the act, a dominating tug of war between sweet and tart with an overbearing zest. As the beer slips back across your tongue the hops demand and definitely get your attention. At 100 IBUs the bitterness smashes into the back of your throat as the resinous, spiced orange peel flavours add depth to the berry fruitiness."
